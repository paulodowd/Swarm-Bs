# Swarm-Bs

This board is a revised version of the 3Pi_IRComm board.  It uses an Arduino Nano and has extra components:
- LDR
- 3 Potentiometers
- 1 Button
- 1 RGB LED

The Arduino Nano has been used (instead of the pro mini) because it has a built-in USB connector and so is more accessible to program.  

Rather than updating the 3Pi_IRComm repository, it seemed like this board was different enough to have it's own - this way the simpler 3Pi_IRComm board design can persist.
